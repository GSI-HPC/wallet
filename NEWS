                       User-Visible wallet Changes

wallet 0.4 (unreleased)

    Maintain a global cache of ACL verifiers in Wallet::ACL and reuse them
    over the life of the process if we see another ACL line from the same
    scheme, rather than only reusing ACL verifiers within a single ACL.

    Add a subclass of the NetDB ACL verifier that requires the principal
    have an instance of "root" and strips that instance before checking
    NetDB roles.

    Determine the class for object and ACL schema implementations from the
    database rather than a hard-coded list and provide Wallet::Schema
    methods for adding new class mappings.

    Add a missing class mapping for the netdb ACL schema verifier.

wallet 0.3 (2007-12-03)

    MySQL is now a supported database backend and the full test suite
    passes with MySQL.

    Add support for running a user-defined function whenever an object is
    created by a non-ADMIN user and using the default owner ACL returned
    by that function provided that the calling user is authorized by that
    ACL.  This permits dynamic creation of new objects based on a default
    owner ACL programmatically determined from the name of the object.

    Attempt to create the object with a default owner on get and store
    when the object doesn't exist.

    Add support for displaying the history of objects and ACLs.

    Add an ACL verifier that checks access against NetDB roles using the
    NetDB remctl interface.

    The wallet backend script now logs all commands and errors to syslog.

    The keytab backend now supports limiting generated keytabs to
    particular enctypes by setting an attribute on the object.

    Expiration dates are now expressed in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS instead of
    seconds since epoch and returned the same way.  Timestamps are now
    stored in the database as correct date and time types rather than
    seconds since epoch to work properly with MySQL.

    The wallet backend test suite now supports using a database other than
    SQLite for testing.

wallet 0.2 (2007-10-08)

    First public alpha release.  Only tested with SQLite 3, no history
    support, no object list support, and only keytab object and krb5 ACL
    support.

wallet 0.1 (2007-03-08)

    Internal release containing only kasetkey, a stub client, and design
    documentation.
