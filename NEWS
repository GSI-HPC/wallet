                       User-Visible wallet Changes

wallet 0.9 (unreleased)

    Add support for enabling and disabling principals (clearing or setting
    the NOTGS flag) and examining principals to kasetkey.  This
    functionality isn't used by wallet (and probably won't be) but is
    convenient for other users of kasetkey such as kadmin-remctl.

    Report the correct error message when addprinc fails while creating a
    keytab object.

    The configure option requesting AFS kaserver support (and thus
    building kasetkey) is now --with-kaserver instead of --with-afs.

    If KRB5_CONFIG was explicitly set in the environment, don't use a
    different krb5-config based on --with-krb4 or --with-krb5.  If
    krb5-config isn't executable, don't use it.  This allows one to
    force library probing by setting KRB5_CONFIG to point to a
    nonexistent file.

    Sanity-check the results of krb5-config before proceeding and error
    out in configure if they don't work.

    Fix Autoconf syntax error when probing for libkrb5support.  Thanks,
    Mike Garrison.

    Stop setting Stanford-specific compile-time defaults for the wallet
    server and port.

    Perl 5.8 is required to run the test suite, but IO::String is not.

    Include Stanford's wallet.conf as an example (examples/stanford.conf).

wallet 0.8 (2008-02-13)

    Fix the wallet client to use check instead of exists.

    Add file object support to the wallet server.

    Correctly handle get of an empty object in the wallet client.  The
    empty string is valid object content.

    Wallet::Config and hence the wallet server now checks for the
    environment variable WALLET_CONFIG and loads configuration from the
    file specified there instead of /etc/wallet/wallet.conf if it is set.

    wallet-backend now supports a -q flag, which disables syslog logging.

    wallet-admin now supports registering new object or ACL verifier
    implementations in the database.

    Remove the restriction that all object implementations must have class
    names of Wallet::Object::* and all ACL verifier implementations must
    have class names of Wallet::ACL::*.

    Add a full end-to-end test suite to catch protocol mismatches between
    the client and server, such as the one fixed in this release.

    Update the design documentation to reflect the current protocol and
    implementation.

wallet 0.7 (2008-02-08)

    Add new exists and autocreate wallet server interfaces.  The first
    states whether a given object exists and the second attempts to create
    the object using the default owner rules.  Remove default owner
    handling from the create interface, which is now for administrators
    only.  Remove server-side auto-creation of objects on get or store and
    instead have the client check for object existence and call autocreate
    if necessary.  This removes confusion between default ACLs and
    administrative object creation for users who are also on the ADMIN
    ACL.

    When creating a srvtab based on a just-downloaded keytab, extract the
    srvtab key before merging the keytab into an existing file.
    Otherwise, if the new keys had a lower kvno than the old keys
    (possible after deleting and recreating the object), the wrong key
    would be extracted for the srvtab.

    keytab-backend now passes kadmin.local ktadd its options in a specific
    order to satisfy the picky option parser.

    Check naming policy on wallet object creation before checking the
    default ACLs to avoid creating and stranding an ACL when the naming
    policy check fails.

    The current version of Net::Remctl can't handle explicit undef or the
    empty string as a principal argument.  Be careful not to provide a
    principal argument if no principal was set.  This workaround can be
    removed once we depend on a later version of Net::Remctl.

    Correctly enable syslog logging in wallet-backend.

    Fix the example remctl configuration for keytab-backend to use the
    correct script name.

wallet 0.6 (2008-01-28)

    SECURITY: If -f is used and the output file name with ".new" appended
    already exists, unlink it first and then create it safely rather than
    truncating it.  This is much safer when creating files in a
    world-writable directory.

    The wallet client can now get the server, port, principal, and remctl
    type from krb5.conf as well as from compile-time defaults and
    command-line options.

    When getting a keytab with the client with no -f option, correctly
    write the keytab to standard output rather than dying with a cryptic
    error.

    When downloading a keytab to a file that already exists, merge the new
    keytab keys into that file rather than moving aside the old keytab and
    creating a new keytab with only the new keys.

    The wallet client now supports a -u option, saying to obtain Kerberos
    credentials for the given user and use those for authentication rather
    than using an existing ticket cache.

    Add a wallet-admin program which can initialize and destroy the
    database and list all objects and ACLs in the database.

    Support enforcing a naming policy for wallet objects via a Perl
    function in the wallet server configuration file.

    The build system now probes for GSS-API, Kerberos v5 and v4, and AFS
    libraries as necessary rather than hard-coding libraries.  Building
    on systems without strong shared library dependencies and building
    against static libraries should now work.

    Building kasetkey (for AFS kaserver synchronization) is now optional
    and not enabled by default.  Pass --with-afs to configure to enable
    it.  This allows wallet to be easily built in an environment without
    AFS.

    Add a sample script (contrib/wallet-report) showing one way of
    reporting on the contents of the wallet database.  This will
    eventually become more general.

wallet 0.5 (2007-12-06)

    Allow the empty string in wallet-backend arguments.

    Allow @ in wallet-backend arguments so that principal names can be
    passed in.

    Load the Perl modules for ACL verifiers and object types dynamically
    now that we're reading the class from the database.

    Correctly implement the documented intention that setting an attribute
    to the empty string clears the attribute values.

    Fix the keytab principal validation regex to allow instances
    containing periods.  Otherwise, it's hard to manage host keytabs.  Add
    a missing test suite for that method.

    When writing to a file in the wallet client program, remove an old
    backup file before creating a new backup and don't fail if the backup
    already exists.

    Check a default creation ACL first before the ADMIN ACL when deciding
    whether we can auto-create a non-existent ACL, since creating one with
    the ADMIN ACL doesn't create a useful object.

wallet 0.4 (2007-12-05)

    Maintain a global cache of ACL verifiers in Wallet::ACL and reuse them
    over the life of the process if we see another ACL line from the same
    scheme, rather than only reusing ACL verifiers within a single ACL.

    Add a subclass of the NetDB ACL verifier that requires the principal
    have an instance of "root" and strips that instance before checking
    NetDB roles.

    Determine the class for object and ACL schema implementations from the
    database rather than a hard-coded list and provide Wallet::Schema
    methods for adding new class mappings.

    Add a missing class mapping for the netdb ACL schema verifier.

    Various coding style fixes and cleanup based on a much-appreciated
    code audit by Simon Cozens.  I didn't take all of his advise, and he
    shouldn't be blamed for any remaining issues.

wallet 0.3 (2007-12-03)

    MySQL is now a supported database backend and the full test suite
    passes with MySQL.

    Add support for running a user-defined function whenever an object is
    created by a non-ADMIN user and using the default owner ACL returned
    by that function provided that the calling user is authorized by that
    ACL.  This permits dynamic creation of new objects based on a default
    owner ACL programmatically determined from the name of the object.

    Attempt to create the object with a default owner on get and store
    when the object doesn't exist.

    Add support for displaying the history of objects and ACLs.

    Add an ACL verifier that checks access against NetDB roles using the
    NetDB remctl interface.

    The wallet backend script now logs all commands and errors to syslog.

    The keytab backend now supports limiting generated keytabs to
    particular enctypes by setting an attribute on the object.

    Expiration dates are now expressed in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS instead of
    seconds since epoch and returned the same way.  Timestamps are now
    stored in the database as correct date and time types rather than
    seconds since epoch to work properly with MySQL.

    The wallet backend test suite now supports using a database other than
    SQLite for testing.

wallet 0.2 (2007-10-08)

    First public alpha release.  Only tested with SQLite 3, no history
    support, no object list support, and only keytab object and krb5 ACL
    support.

wallet 0.1 (2007-03-08)

    Internal release containing only kasetkey, a stub client, and design
    documentation.
