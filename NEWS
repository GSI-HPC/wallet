                       User-Visible wallet Changes

wallet 0.3 (unreleased)

    Add support for running a user-defined function whenever an object is
    created by a non-ADMIN user and using the default owner ACL returned
    by that function provided that the calling user is authorized by that
    ACL.  This permits dynamic creation of new objects based on a default
    owner ACL programmatically determined from the name of the object.

    Attempt to create the object with a default owner on get and store
    when the object doesn't exist.

    Add support for displaying the history of objects and ACLs.

    Add an ACL verifier that checks access against NetDB roles using the
    NetDB remctl interface.

    The wallet backend script now logs all commands and errors to syslog.

    The keytab backend now supports limiting generated keytabs to
    particular enctypes by setting an attribute on the object.

wallet 0.2 (2007-10-08)

    First public alpha release.  Only tested with SQLite 3, no history
    support, no object list support, and only keytab object and krb5 ACL
    support.

wallet 0.1 (2007-03-08)

    Internal release containing only kasetkey, a stub client, and design
    documentation.
