                              wallet Thanks

To Roland Schemers for the original idea that kicked off this project and
for the original implementation of the leland_srvtab system, which was its
primary inspiration.

To Anton Ushakov for his prior work on Kerberos v5 synchronization and his
enhancements to kasetkey to read a key from an existing srvtab.

To Jeffrey Hutzelman for his review of the original wallet design and
multiple useful discussions about what actions and configurations the
wallet would need to support to be useful outside of Stanford.

To Huaqing Zheng, Paul Pavelko, David Hoffman, and Paul Keser for their
reviews of the wallet system design and comments on design decisions and
security models.

To Jon Robertson for the refactoring of Wallet::Kadmin, Heimdal support,
many of the wallet server-side reports, the initial wallet-rekey
implementation, and lots of work on object and ACL types including nested
ACLs.

To Bill MacAllister for Wallet::Kadmin::AD and the implementation of
keytab object types backed by Active Directory.
