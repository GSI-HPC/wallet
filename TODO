* Remove the hard-coded ADMIN ACL in the server with something more
  configurable, perhaps a global ACL table or something.

* The ACL implementation is currently rather inefficient for ACL
  verifiers that need to maintain state (such as LDAP binds).  Now
  they're created and destroyed when verifying each ACL.  We need to
  somehow return global verifiers, probably through a factory
  implementation.
