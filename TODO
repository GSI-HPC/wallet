                            wallet To-Do List

Required to replace leland_srvtab:

* Add an ACL list function to display an ACL in human-readable form and
  call it from wallet-backend.

* Display ACL details when displaying objects.

* Write new files atomically in the wallet client and save backups unless
  told not to (write to file.new, link the old file to file.old, and do
  an atomic rename).

* Implement creation of srvtabs from keytabs in the wallet client.

* Add kasetkey support to the keytab object backend.

* Implement flag setting and retrieval.

* Implement support for the unchanging flag on keytabs and the backend
  remctl calls to retrieve the existing keytab.

* Implement the locked flag.

* Add support to the test suite for specifying a different database than
  SQLite for testing.  For MySQL and other database types that we can't
  just delete, also requires adding a method to Wallet::Schema to drop all
  of our tables and indices in reverse order of creation.

* Add README and NEWS files and update web page.

* Write the remctl configuration and finish Debian packaging of the
  wallet client and server.

Future work:

* Add POD testing for the client and server programs.

* Add POD coverage testing using Test::POD::Coverage for the server
  modules.

* Provide some way of getting at the history tables.  Need to get object
  and ACL history either by object or for all objects, at least.  Global
  history should be by timestamp and possibly limit by timestamp.

* Provide an interface to list all objects in the database by type, by
  owner (including null), or by all uses of an ACL.

* Provide an interface to list all ACLs in the database.  Most
  interestingly, an interface to list all empty ACLs.

* Log all actions to syslog.

* Write the NetDB ACL verifier.

* Write the LDAP entitlement ACL verifier.

* Write the PTS ACL verifier.

* Add a help function to wallet-backend listing the commands.

* Write a conventions document for ACL naming, object naming, and similar
  issues.

* Write a future design and roadmap document to collect notes about how
  unimplemented features should be handled.

* Support displaying and possibly specifying dates in some format more
  normal than seconds since epoch.

* Log failures in the wallet-backend properly, which also requires
  catching all exceptions.

* Implement default ACL policy to allow dynamic object creation on first
  request for keytabs.

* Implement special handling for keytabs in the wallet client.

* Add support to the wallet client for getting Kerberos tickets, using the
  -u option similar to leland_srvtab.  Needs good error messages on
  Kerberos failures.

* The wallet client should read configuration information from krb5.conf,
  and possibly from some other configuration as well.

* Add support for a default creation policy and default ACLs.  The policy
  function needs to return a list of ACLs, and we'll need an ACL function
  to check the user against such a list rather than an ACL that already
  exists in the database.  When we create such an object, we'll also need
  to name the ACL, which may require fallback logic if the name was
  already taken.

* Use the class names in the database tables when loading object and
  ACL verifier implementations.

* Error messages from ACL operations should refer to the ACLs by name
  instead of by ID.

* The ACL implementation is currently rather inefficient for ACL
  verifiers that need to maintain state (such as LDAP binds).  Now
  they're created and destroyed when verifying each ACL.  We need to
  somehow return global verifiers, probably through a factory
  implementation.

* There is a lot of duplicate code in wallet-backend.  Convert that to
  use some sort of data-driven model with argument count and flags so
  that the method calls can be written only once.

* There's a lot of code duplication in the dispatch functions in the
  Wallet::Server class.  Find a way to rewrite that so that the dispatch
  doesn't duplicate the same code patterns.

* Remove the hard-coded ADMIN ACL in the server with something more
  configurable, perhaps a global ACL table or something.

* Add the database schema version to a global table so that we can use it
  to support schema upgrades in the future.

* On upgrades, support adding new object types and ACL verifiers to the
  class tables.

* Write a wallet-admin program to provide an interface to things like
  database initialization and, eventually, upgrades.

* Add a function to wallet-admin to purge expired entries.  Possibly also
  check expiration before allowing anyone to get or store objects.

* Compiling kasetkey should be optional and probably not enabled by
  default.

* Add a comment field for objects that can be set by the owner.

* Implement store support in the wallet client.  Add an option to read the
  data from a file.  The initial implementation, depending on the
  underlying remctl support, may have to ban nul characters in the
  uploaded data.

* Implement a simple file wallet object.  Document a naming convention for
  those files (group-service, perhaps).

* Implement an ssh keypair wallet object.  The server can run ssh-keygen
  to generate a public/private key pair and return both to the client,
  which would split them apart.  Used primarily for host keys.  May need a
  side table to store key types, or a naming convention.

* Implement an X.509 certificate object.  I expect this would store the
  public and private key as a single file in the same format that Apache
  can read for combined public and private keys.  There were requests for
  storing the CSR, but I don't see why you'd want to do that.  Start with
  store support.

* Implement an X.509 CA so that you can get certificate objects without
  storing them first.  Need to resolve naming conventions if you want to
  run multiple CAs on the same wallet server (but why?).  Should this be a
  different type than stored certificates?

* Add details to design-api on how to write one's own ACL verifiers and
  object implementations.

* Add support for enforcing a naming policy through another policy
  function.

* Add readline support to the wallet client to make it easier to issue
  multiple commands.

* The keytab backend currently only supports MIT Kerberos.  Add support
  for Heimdal.

* The wallet-backend and wallet documentation share the COMMANDS section.
  Work out some means to assemble the documentation without duplicating
  content.

* Add support for rekeying in the wallet client.  Need to resolve how to
  get a list of principals to rekey and which keytabs to work on.  This
  possibly should be a separate binary from the regular wallet client
  binary.

* Document using the wallet system over something other than remctl.

* Provide a REST implementation of the wallet server.

* Document all diagnostics for all wallet APIs.

* Write a test suite to scan all wallet code looking for diagnostics that
  aren't in the documentation and warn about them.
