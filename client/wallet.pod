=head1 NAME

wallet - Client for retrieving secure data from a central server

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<wallet> [B<-hv>] [B<-c> I<command>] [B<-f> I<output>]
[B<-k> I<principal>] [B<-p> I<port>] [B<-s> I<server>] I<command>
[I<arg> ...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<wallet> is a client for the wallet system, which stores or creates
secure information such as Kerberos keytabs, associates them with ACLs and
other metadata, and allows clients to view and download them.  This client
provides the user interface to the wallet system for both users and wallet
administrators.

The B<wallet> command-line client takes a command and optional arguments
on the command line, authenticates to the wallet server using Kerberos,
and sends that command and arguments to server.  It then reads the results
and displays them to the user or stores them in a file.  The client itself
does not know which commands are valid and which aren't; apart from some
special handling of particular commands, it sends all commands to the
server to respond to appropriately.  This allows additional commands to be
added to the wallet system without changing all of the clients.

The primary commands of the wallet system are C<get>, which retrieves some
secure data from the wallet, C<store>, which stores some secure data in
the wallet, and C<show>, which stores the metadata about an object stored
in the wallet.  Each object in the wallet has a type, which determines
what data the object represents and may determine special handling when
downloading or storing that object, and a name.  For example, a wallet
object for the C<host/example.com> Kerberos keytab would have a type of
C<keytab> and a name of C<host/example.com>.  The meaning of the name is
specific to each type of object.

Most other wallet commands besides those three are only available to
wallet administrators.  The other commands allow setting ownership and
ACLs on objects, creating and destroying objects, creating and destroying
ACLs, and adding and removing entries from ACLs.  An ACL consists of one
or more entries, each of which is a scheme and an identifier.  A scheme
specifies a way of checking whether a user is authorized.  An identifier
is some data specific to the scheme that specifies which users are
authorized.  For example, for the C<krb5> scheme, the identifier is a
principal name and only that principal is authorized by that ACL entry.
For the C<pts> scheme, the identifier is a PTS group name, and all members
of that PTS group are authorized by that ACL entry.

To run the wallet command-line client, you must already have a Kerberos
ticket.  You can obtain a Kerberos ticket with B<kinit> and see your
current Kerberos tickets with B<klist>.  The wallet client uses the remctl
protocol to talk to the wallet server.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-c> I<command>

The command prefix (remctl type) to use.  Normally this is an internal
implementation detail and the default (C<wallet>) should be fine.  It may
sometimes be useful to use a different prefix for testing a different
version of the wallet code on the server.

=item B<-f> I<output>

This flag is only used in combination with the C<get> command.  Rather
than sending the secure data to standard output (the default), store the
secure data in the file I<output>.  Any existing contents of I<output>
will be destroyed.

=item B<-k> I<principal>

The service principal of the wallet server.  The default is to use the
C<host> principal for the wallet server.  The principal chosen must match
one of the keys in the keytab used by B<remctld> on the wallet server.

=item B<-h>

Display a brief summary of options and exit.  All other valid options and
commands are ignored.

=item B<-p> I<port>

The port to connect to on the wallet server.  The default is the default
remctl port (4444).

=item B<-s> I<server>

The wallet server to connect to.  The default is a hard-coded server value
determined at configure time when compiling the wallet client.

=item B<-v>

Display the version of the B<wallet> client and exit.  All other valid
options and commands are ignored.

=head1 COMMANDS

As mentioned above, most commands are only available to wallet
administrators.  The exceptions are C<get>, C<store>, C<show>, C<destroy>,
C<flag clear>, C<flag set>, C<getattr>, and C<setattr>.  All of those
commands have their own ACLs except C<getattr>, which uses the C<show>
ACL, and C<setattr>, which uses the C<show> ACL.  If the appropriate ACL
is set, it alone is checked to see if the user has access.  Otherwise,
C<get>, C<store>, C<show>, C<getattr>, and C<setattr> access is permitted
if the user is authorized by the owner ACL of the object.

Administrators can run any command on any object or ACL except for C<get>
and C<store>.  For C<get> and C<show>, they must still be authorized by
either the appropriate specific ACL or the owner ACL.

If the locked flag is set on an object, no commands can be run on that
object that change data except the C<flags> commands, nor can the C<get>
command be used on that object.  C<show>, C<getacl>, and C<owner> or
C<expires> without an argument can still be used on that object.

=over 4

=item acl add <id> <scheme> <identifier>

Adds an entry with <scheme> and <identifier> to the ACL <id>.  <id> may be
either the name of an ACL or its numeric identifier.

=item acl create <name>

Create a new, empty ACL with name <name>.  When setting an ACL on an
object with a set of entries that don't match an existing ACL, first
create a new ACL with C<acl create>, add the appropriate entries to it
with C<acl add>, and then set the ACL on an object with the C<owner> or
C<setacl> commands.

=item acl destroy <id>

Destroy the ACL <id>.  This ACL must no longer be referenced by any object
or the ACL destruction will fail.  The special ACL named C<ADMIN> cannot
be destroyed.

=item acl remove <id> <scheme> <identifier>

Remove the entry with <scheme> and <identifier> from the ACL <id>.  <id>
may be either the name of an ACL or its numeric identifier.  The last
entry in the special ACL C<ADMIN> cannot be removed to protect against
accidental lockout, but administrators can remove themselves from the
C<ADMIN> ACL and can leave only a non-functioning entry on the ACL.  Use
caution when removing entries from the C<ADMIN> ACL.

=item acl show <id>

Display the name, numeric ID, and entries of the ACL <id>.

=item create <type> <name>

Create a new object of type <type> with name <name>.  With some backends,
this will trigger creation of an entry in an external system as well.
The new object will have no ACLs and no owner set, so usually the
administrator will want to then set an owner with C<owner> so that the
object will be usable.

=item destroy <type> <name>

Destroy the object identified by <type> and <name>.  With some backends,
this will trigger destruction of an object in an external system as well.

=item expires <type> <name> [<expires>]

If <expires> is not given, displays the current expiration of the object
identified by <type> and <name>, or C<No expiration set> if none is set.
The expiration will be displayed in seconds since epoch.

If <expires> is given, sets the expiration on the object identified by
<type> and <name> to <expires>.  <expires> should be given in seconds
since epoch.  If <expires> is the empty string, clears the expiration of
the object.

Currently, the expiration of an object is not used.

=item flag clear <type> <name> <flag>

Clears the flag <flag> on the object identified by <type> and <name>.

=item flag set <type> <name> <flag>

Sets the flag <flag> on the object identified by <type> and <name>.
Recognized flags are C<locked>, which prevents all further actions on that
object until the flag is cleared, and C<unchanging>, which tells the object
backend to not generate new data on get but instead return the same data as
previously returned.  The C<unchanging> flag is not meaningful for objects
that do not generate new data on the fly.

=item get <type> <name>

Prints to standard output the data associated with the object identified
by <type> and <name>, or stores it in a file if the B<-f> option was
given.  This may trigger generation of new data and invalidate old data
for that object depending on the object type.

=item getacl <type> <name> <acl>

Prints the ACL <acl>, which must be one of C<get>, C<store>, C<show>,
C<destroy>, or C<flags>, for the object identified by <type> and <name>.
Prints C<No ACL set> if that ACL isn't set on that object.  Remember that
if the C<get>, C<store>, or C<show> ACLs aren't set, authorization falls
back to checking the owner ACL.  See the C<owner> command for displaying
or setting it.

=item getattr <type> <name> <attr>

Prints the object attribute <attr> for the object identified by <type> and
<name>.  Attributes are used to store backend-specific information for a
particular object type, and <attr> must be an attribute type known to the
underlying object implementation.  The attribute values, if any, are
printed one per line.  If the attribute is not set on this object, nothing
is printed.

=item owner <type> <name> [<owner>]

If <owner> is not given, displays the current owner ACL of the object
identified by <type> and <name>, or C<No owner set> if none is set.  The
result will be the name of an ACL.

If <owner> is given, sets the owner of the object identified by <type> and
<name> to <owner>.  If <owner> is the empty string, clears the owner of
the object.

=item setacl <type> <name> <acl> <id>

Sets the ACL <acl>, which must be one of C<get>, C<store>, C<show>,
C<destroy>, or C<flags>, to <id> on the object identified by <type> and
<name>.  If <id> is the empty string, clears that ACL on the object.

=item setattr <type> <name> <attr> <value> [<value> ...]

Sets the object attribute <attr> for the object identified by <type> and
<name>.  Attributes are used to store backend-specific information for a
particular object type, and <attr> must be an attribute type known to the
underlying object implementation.  To clear the attribute for this object,
pass in a <value> of the empty string (C<''>).

Currently, no object attributes are implemented.

=item show <type> <name>

Displays the current object metadata for the object identified by <type>
and <name>.  This human-readable output will show the object type and
name, the owner, any specific ACLs set on the object, the expiration if
any, and the user, remote host, and time when the object was created, last
stored, and last downloaded.

=item store <type> <name> <data>

Stores <data> for the object identified by <type> and <name> for later
retrieval with C<get>.  Not all object types support this.

Currently, <data> is limited to not containing nul characters and may
therefore not be binary data, and is limited by the maximum command line
length of the operating system of the wallet server.  These restrictions
will be lifted in the future.
