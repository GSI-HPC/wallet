# /etc/remctl/acl/wallet-report -- ACL for wallet reporting.
#
# This is the ACL controlling who can run reports against the wallet
# database using wallet-report via remctl.  This backend doesn't allow any
# modification of data or retrieval of stored data, but does allow
# examination of all of the metadata in the wallet database.
