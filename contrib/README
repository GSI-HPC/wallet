This directory contains various supporting scripts used with wallet at
Stanford University.  They embed various paths, assumptions about object
naming, local site policy, and similar quirks specific to Stanford and
therefore will require modification for use at other sites.

They may, however, be useful as examples of how to do various things with
wallet or use the wallet Perl API outside of the provided backend scripts,
or as a basis for similar local infrastructure.
