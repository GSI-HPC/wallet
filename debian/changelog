wallet (0.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Add support for Heimdal KDCs as well as MIT Kerberos KDCs.  New
      mandatory configuration setting KEYTAB_KRBTYPE which must be set to
      either MIT or Heimdal.
    - Remove kaserver synchronization support and kasetkey.
    - wallet -S now generates a srvtab based on the DES key of the keytab
      and does not enable synchronization.  No synchronization targets are
      supported now.
    - The wallet client and wallet-backend server can now handle store of
      files containing nuls provided that the server uses remctl 2.14 and
      the remctl configuration is updated to use stdin=last.
    - Correctly store data that begins with a dash.
    - Do not log the data passed to store.
    - New wallet-report script and multiple additional database reports.
    - Report ACL names as well as numbers in object history.
  * Update debhelper compatibility level to V7.
    - Use debhelper rule minimization with overrides.
    - Add ${misc:Depends} to dependencies.
  * Clarify in long description that keytab-backend is only needed for MIT
    Kerberos.
  * Move wallet-server's dependency on krb5-user to Recommends, since it's
    only needed for keytab support, and allow libheimdal-kadm5-perl as an
    alternative.
  * Recommend remctl-server 2.14 or later for improved store support.
  * Add Homepage, Vcs-Git, and Vcs-Browser control fields.
  * Add a watch file.
  * Update standards version to 3.8.4 (no changes required).
