                              NetDB Role API

Basic API

    remctl netdb-node-roles-rc netdb node-roles <sunetid> <node>

    Note that the remctl principal used here is actually the underlying
    host principal, not the principal for that alias.  <node> must be
    fully qualified.  This will return a list of all roles that <sunetid>
    has with <node>, chosen from admin, team, or user.  For our purposes,
    we probably want to look at admin and team, but we may want user as
    well.

    You must be a current NetDB user to use it.  It just sucks rows out of
    a view matching on the SUNet ID and node name, so getting no result
    can mean "no such SUNet ID," "no such node," or "SUNet ID isn't
    associated with node."

Examples

    % remctl netdb-node-roles-rc netdb node-roles riepel zathras.stanford.edu
    admin
    team
    user
    % remctl netdb-node-roles-rc netdb node-roles riepel calgon.stanford.edu
    admin
    %

Wallet Issues

    We'll need to get a principal registered to use it that can query
    anything for any node but isn't otherwise authorized to use NetDB.
