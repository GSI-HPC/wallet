                      Wallet Installation and Setup

MySQL Database Setup

    After installing the MySQL server, connect as a user with permissions
    to create new databases and users.  Then, issue the following
    commands:

        create database wallet;
        create user wallet identified by 'PASSWORD';
        grant all on wallet.* to wallet;

    This creates a wallet user that can be used by the rest of the wallet
    system and gives it access to the wallet database, where it can create
    its own tables.
