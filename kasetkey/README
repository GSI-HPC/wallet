This program used to be called gen_srvtab and was the backend used by the
old sysctl-based srvtab distribution system.  It can either load a key
from a srvtab and push it into the AFS kaserver or generate a random key,
push it into the AFS kaserver, and then write it out as a srvtab.  It has
a lot of strange issues (such as deleting and then recreating keys rather
than changing the key and incrementing the kvno), but it works.

This program only works with the AFS kaserver and requires the AFS
libraries to compile.

I haven't yet done the work to make compilation optional based on whether
one wants to build kaserver support (or worked out how that will be
configured in general).  That's for later.
