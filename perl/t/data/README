This directory contains additional data files needed to run some tests.

In order to run the keytab tests, you will need to grant the test
processes access to create, download, and remove principals in a test KDC.
This should not be pointed at a production KDC!  Then, create the
following files:

    test.keytab         Keytab for an authorized user
    test.principal      Principal of the authorized user
    test.realm          Kerberos realm in which to do testing

This realm will also need to be configured in your local krb5.conf,
including the admin_server for the realm.

The test process will create the principals wallet/one and wallet/two and
on success will clean up after itself.  If the test fails, they may be
left behind in the KDC.

For MIT Kerberos, to grant appropriate permissions, add the line:

    <principal>         admci   wallet/*@<realm>

to the kadm5.acl file for your master KDC for the test realm and restart
kadmind.  <principal> is the principal that you are using to test with,
and <realm> is the Kerberos realm.

Again, I do not recommend using a production realm; the test doesn't need
a production realm and it's more secure to stick to a test realm.
