This directory contains configuration required to run the complete wallet
test suite.  If there is no configuration in this directory, some of the
tests will be skipped.  To enable the full test suite, create the
following files:

keytab

    A valid Kerberos keytab for a principal, preferrably in your local
    realm.  This will be used to test network interactions that require
    Kerberos authentication.

principal

    The name of the Kerberos principal whose keys are stored in keytab.

password

    This file should contain two lines.  The first line is the
    fully-qualified principal (including the realm) of a Kerberos
    principal to use for testing authentication.  The second line is
    the password for that principal.  The realm of the principal must
    be configured in your system krb5.conf file or in DNS configuration
    picked up by your Kerberos libraries and must be in the same realm as
    the keytab above or have valid cross-realm trust to it.

If you are building in a different directory tree than the source tree,
don't put the files in this directory.  Instead, after running configure,
you will have an empty tests/config directory in your build tree.  Put the
keytab and principal files in that directory instead.

If your krb5.conf file is not in /etc or /usr/local/etc, put a copy of
your krb5.conf file in the tests/data directory.  The tests need to
generate a modified copy in order to test some behavior.
